## A good data model
- capture all the data the system needs
- capture only the data the system needs
- reflects reality
- is flexible, can evolve with the systems
- guarantees data integrity
- is driven by the way data will  be used

## Components
- entities: the nouns === resource -> tables
- attributes/properties -> columns
- relationships between entities === sub routes -> foreign keys

## Workflow
- identify the entities
- identify the attributes
- identify relationships 


## Relationships
- one to one > one to zero or one
- one to money: most common type
- many to many(doesn't really exist) -> need a third table
